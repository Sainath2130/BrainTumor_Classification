# BrainTumor_Classification
This project implements a deep learning model to classify brain tumors from medical images. It utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for model building and training, and leverages libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation and evaluation.
## Features

* **Image Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The notebook reads image filepaths and labels, organizes them into DataFrames, and prepares the data for model training.
* **Tumor Type Classification:** The model is designed to classify images into categories such as meningioma tumor, glioma tumor, pituitary tumor, and no tumor.
* **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** A CNN architecture is implemented using TensorFlow/Keras to extract features from the images and perform classification.
* **Model Training and Evaluation:** The notebook includes code for training the model, potentially with techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling, and evaluates its performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
* **Data Visualization:** Libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for visualizing data and results.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Data

The notebook assumes the data is organized in a directory structure with separate folders for each tumor type (meningioma, glioma, pituitary, and no tumor).  You will need to provide your own dataset organized similarly.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have the required libraries installed (you can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you create a requirements file).
3.  Modify the file paths in the notebook to point to your dataset.
4.  Run the notebook cells to train and evaluate the model.

## Potential Improvements

* Detailed data exploration and visualization.
* Implementation of various CNN architectures.
* Hyperparameter tuning.
* Data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
* More rigorous evaluation metrics and validation strategies.
